  Since moving to Washington, I've started following a lot of different blogs of people sailing in the Pacific Northwest (PNW).  A few weeks ago I found a super useful link which contained sailing distances and times from and to different ports in the PNW.  Need to know how many nautical miles it is from Shilshole Marina to Eagle Harbor?  <a title="Shilshole Bay distances" href="http://nwcruising.net/nm_folders/shilshole.html">BAM</a> (it's 7 nm which takes an hour by the way)!  All of the times are based off of going 7.0 knots which might be a little faster than Makai can sustain but it's still useful regardless.  If you're sailing (or motoring) in or around the PNW, I highly recommend checking out <a title="Time and Distance Tables in PNW" href="http://nwcruising.net/nmtable.html">nwcruising's time and distance tables</a>.  In order to keep better track of the information, I've added a new page of <a title="Useful Information" href="{{ "/useful-info" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Useful Information</a> to the site.
