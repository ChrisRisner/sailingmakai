Welcome to our website!  We are excited to have a place to post about our adventures in boating and boat ownership.
</p>
<p>
	In mid-April we sold our first sailboat, The Michigander, and shortly thereafter bought our new sailboat.  This past weekend, after having the transom painted so we could get rid of the old name, we finally performed the <a title="Boat Renaming Ceremony" href="http://boatsafe.com/nauticalknowhow/rename.htm">boat renaming ceremony</a> (to appease the gods and prevent us from sinking...hopefully) and christened our boat <a title="About Makai" href="http://sailingmakai.com/about-makai/">Makai.</a>
</p>

</p>
<p>
	Now that the boat has been renamed, we plan to post as much as possible about working on the boat and sailing in and around the Pacific Northwest.  We  look forward to sharing our experiences with you!
